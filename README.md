# Formula E

Small iOS app showing Formula E drivers and their details.

The app was built using MVVM+C pattern and all user interface is done through code.

The app requires Facebook login, but only stores user information locally.

Also, unit tests were made to test the business logic / flow of the app (vms, services etc.).

This app was made using my own [FormulaAPI](https://github.com/aivcec/FormulaAPI), as well as a number of other pods.
